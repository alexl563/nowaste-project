# Food Waste in NYC - Data Science Project üçâ

Food waste is very prevelant within the United States, and we wanted to look at how common it was. We decided to use the nation's largest city to understand/analyze any trends or correlations that may exist. 

## Motiviation

We wanted to analyze and illustrate trends between neighborhood profile demographics and their respective food scrap centers within NYC and its boroughs. 

## Methods

We used publically accessible opensource datasets to best illustrate waste with NYC. We found a dataset from NYC open data, and then we refined it using pandas. After that, we graphed our data with Plotly and integrated it into a website using Dash.
