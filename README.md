# Food Waste in NYC - Data Science Project

~Motivation for this project was to analyze and illustrate trends between neighborhood profile demographics and their respective food scrap centers within NYC and its boroughs. Food waste is very prevelant within the United States, and we wanted to look at how common it was. We decided to use the nation's largest city to understand/analyze any trends or correlations that may exist. 

~Project uses publically accessible opensource datasets to best illustrate waste with NYC through using Plotly. 

~Languages used: HTML, CSS, Python
